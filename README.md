Description: Geometric-aware velocity controller based on quadratic programming (QP) and manipuability ellipsoid, combined with an admittance controller.

Expand the tracking method from Noemie Jaquier (2020) into a QP-based velocity controller (From Matlab to C++).

Hint: This package is a ros package, which should be used together with franka_ros.
